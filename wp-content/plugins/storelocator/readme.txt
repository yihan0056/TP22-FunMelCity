**How Does it Work?**

‚öíÔ∏è Our Store Locator Map is powered by data from Google Sheets. So first, you have to install a <a href="https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/store_locator/734551689349">Google Sheets Addon</a>

üèôÔ∏è Then you create a Google sheet and add your store addresses starting from street name, city, country with other details like phone number, email address and store specific information.

üó∫Ô∏è Once the data is filled, you will run the <a href="https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/store_locator/734551689349">Google Sheets Addon</a> to generate a Store Locator Link.

‚úÇÔ∏è üìã Copy-Paste the link inside this WordPress plugin and set the path to the page where you want to embed the Store Locator.

That‚Äôs all! Store addresses are converted to map coordinates inside Google sheet (longitudes and latitudes). Geo-mapping is done in seconds. If Google sheet doesn‚Äôt recognize a store location, you can add the coordinates directly under the ‚ÄúCoordinates‚Äù column in the Google Sheet. Store locator works on all mobile devices, tablets and desktops. It‚Äôs a 100% responsive and mobile-friendly map.

The co-ordinates in the Google sheet are shown on the map generated by Mapbox. (You don‚Äôt have to bother about the hassle of working with Google Maps Platform, or using Google Map API keys or even with Open Street Map with our WordPress plugin). We take care of plotting the points on the map with markers. Map zoom in and map zoom out is available with Mapbox and it moves from marker to marker swiftly.

A search field is added to the map. Users can search on the store locator map by location, ZIP or PIN. They can also search for locations near them with a single click. All stores are listed on the side of the map.

**Why do you need a Store Locator?**

Your business needs a store locator. It's the best tool to show all the locations in one map and any customer will be able to find your store or business office easily, with accurate results and map points. The perfect tool for any type of business that has multiple locations.

Our product allows you to plot your stores or office locations on an interactive map and embed the map on your website. It also comes with search functionality and filters for each store location.

= How much coding is involved? =

Zero! You add store addresses in a sheet, generate a Store Locator URL. Copy-paste the URL inside the WordPress plugin.

= Why do I need to install the Sheet Addon? =

The address information of each store or business location is accessed from Google sheets. Therefore you install our <a href="https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/store_locator/734551689349">Google Sheets Addon</a> and generate your Store locator URL with unique ID.

= How to add Store Locator Map to WordPress Page or Post? =

You can add our shortcode in the format, [storelocator id="cNZvjE"]. The id is the last part of the Store Locator URL that you will get from the sheet addon.

= Do I need to use any Map API or access token? =

Not required. We have designed our product so that you need to bother with the hassle of obtaining an access token or API keys. However, if you are familiar with Mapbox and want to use your own access token, you have the option for that too.

= Why is Update Map on Google sheet taking time? =

Store Locator add on calculates the co-ordinates of each store location one at a time. If you have more than 500 or 1000 stores, you may see that it takes some time to finish the calculation.

= Why does the Co-ordinate column in Google sheet show a red cell? =

The co-ordinates are generated based on the information provided in the Google sheet. When there is insufficient data to find the latitude and longitude, the sheet shows a red cell. You can insert this information directly into the cell to solve this matter.

= I changed my store address, but the location on the map doesn‚Äôt change? =

Just delete the co-ordinate information of that store in Google sheet and click on Add-on menu > Update map from the sheet. The map will get automatically updated.

= Why can‚Äôt I add the ‚Äú+‚Äù symbol for phone numbers? =

When adding phone numbers in international format inside Google sheet, ‚Äò+‚Äô in the beginning is treated as a formula. To show a number as +1 555666000, please enter this data as =‚Äù+1 55566600 under the Mobile number column. This will format the number in the international format.

= How to add more filters and tags to the map? =

You may add more columns in the Google sheet and specify these new columns under the Add-on menu > Settings > Edit fields.

= Translation: Change I change words on the frontend? Can I translate words into my own language? =
You can do this by clicking the MORE SETTINGS button when editing the calculator.
Click here for more information https://designful.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/48001142233

= Tax / VAT : Can I charge tax or VAT? =
This feature is reserved for our premium users. You can charge tax or VAT by doing the following.

= Can this plugin do this "Length x Width x Height / Unit Price = Price" ? =
We receive a lot of queries from users asking this question.

As of right now, we're not able to have products or services multiply each other. The only exception is with the slider. The slider is able to multiply the quantity of the slider amount (units) to the price of any dropdown or checkbox element that sits inside the same subsection.


We're looking into developing this in the future.

1. You can add the tax in the more settings
2. You can change the name "tax" to "VAT" in the translation settings.
https://designful.freshdesk.com/a/solutions/articles/48001145355

= Variable Math: Is there a feature to add variables? =
Currently, we don't have this feature. However, we do have custom math feature, which is similar.

Stylish Cost Calculator was originally designed and developed to be more easy-to-use and stylish, than comprehensive. However, we're coming out with an advanced mode for more versatility without compromising our user-friendliness.

https://designful.freshdesk.com/a/solutions/articles/48001151624

= What's the difference between premium and demo versions of this website cost calculator for WordPress? =
The premium version has the PDF, Paypal and Woocommerce features. It also allows for extra customizations.

= =

= Does this plugin handle negative numbers?=
Yes, you can now use negative numbers with the Stylish Cost Calculator. You can have a -$3 price.

= Does it require a person to know coding? =
Well, the answer is not really. We have designed it to be very user-friendly and very much unlike the other complicated, harder-to-use, cost calculators on the market. But we do expect the users to understand WordPress to an intermediate level. We're struggling to keep on top of the high-volume support emails and cannot help novice WordPress users enter in Shortcodes or other non-related plugin questions. As much as we love helping people, we only have so much time in the day at this moment. You can actually help make our support better and faster by making a review on our WordPress.org page to attract more sales to afford more support staff.

= Does this plugin come with a document upload feature? =
Unfortunately, not. Yet, we can do this in the future. It's not projected to be done this summer or fall 2020.

= Change I change the front-end language of the WordPress price quote plugin? =
Yes, there is a translation feature that allows you to change the words on the frontend to any language. Or, you can use this same feature to change the wordings to any word, even if it's in English too. Example: "Add to Cart" to "Buy Now"

= Does it integrate with Paypal? =
Yes, in the premium version of this calculator plugin for WordPress.

= Does this WordPress cost calculator integrate with Woocommerce? =
Yes, in the premium version, you can use this as a woocommerce calculator. Users can get an instant quote and click the 'add to cart' button.
You must first create the products in woocommerce, then link the products in each element in the backend of Stylish Cost Calculator while you're editing the instance.

= Are there one-click templates to quickly load and get going quickly? =
Yes, in both the free and premium versions. Click add new calculator and you will see the templates.

= Is this plugin secure? WordPress plugins are known for being insecure and can pose security risks =
We spent a lot of time and money working with coderisk.com to ensure our plugin is safe and secure.

= Will the plugin slow down my site? =
We spent a lot of time and money to optimize the plugin for speed. We're an SEO company, too. Our JS and CSS files are minified, slimmed down and minimized. On average, it will add 0.6-1 seconds of load time to the page it's displayed on.

== Disclaimer ==
Ideally, it’s best that you have a basic understanding of web development (HTML, CSS, WordPress) to use this cost calculator WordPress plugin.  By purchasing the license, you agree to have access to basic and limited support, mainly for troubleshooting bugs. We do not offer refunds, so please test the demo first before purchasing.

The Stylish Cost Calculator plugin does have a variable math feature. Meaning, you cannot write custom similar to $Product x $Quantity = $Total. There are other plugins on the market which allow this but are much more difficult to setup. Our plugin was designed to more easy-to-use than work for complex pricing structures. Although thousands of users find this plugin does exactly what they’re looking for, we don’t guarantee it will work for your situation. We encourage you to use the free version first to try it out.

# 1 Project Introduction

The FunMelCity project is about Work, Live and Play in Melbourne as International Students. When international students arrive in Melbourne city for the first time in the first 3-6 months, because of their limited knowledge of Melbourne, the international students can encounter many problems in accommodation, transportation, socialisation, local laws, healthy life and job opportunities. Our target audiences are focused on the international students who are 18-25 years old. We want to provide all the essential information they need to start their journey in Melbourne to reduce their frustration.

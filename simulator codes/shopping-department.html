                    <span style="font-weight: 900;font-size: 30px;"> Big W </span> is a division of Woolworths in Australia. There are 182 stores across the country. It is a discount department store. I buy large bottles of washing powder, shower gel and body lotion from there.

                    <span style="font-weight: 900;font-size: 30px;"> Target.</span>  According to their website “Target is an iconic Australian retailer dedicated to making fashion, style and quality affordable for the whole family.” I do quite like Target for clothes and find the prices very reasonable.
